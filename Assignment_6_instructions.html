<h2>Question 1</h2>

<p>
	Thanks to your help, Mr Omondi’s business is doing even better.</br> 
	Now he want to expand his business into Moto renting </br> 
	Motos still have the same data as cars, but for moto’s because they have helmets, </br> 
	he needs to be able to know the number of helmets available for that moto.</br> 
	Mr Omondi is worried about the planet and he would like to calculate the carbon footprint of every vehicle.</br> 
	The formula for carbon footprint calculation is </br> 
	
	<h4>Car</h4>
	Number of years since released *12000(average miles per car yearly)*15 (gallons per mile)</br> 
	*9 (grams of co2 per gallon)</br> 
	
	<h4>Moto</h4>
	Number of year since released*10000(average miles yearly)*2(gallons per mile)*9(grams /gallon) </br> 
</p>
<p>
  I will need you to sumbit the following files  </br> 
  main_program_file : </br> 
  which has the controll flow of your program </br> 
  vichle_file : </br> 
  containing the parent vehicle class</br> 
  Test_vehicle_file : </br> 
  containing the function calls of all the functions created in the vehicle class</br> 
  car_class_file : </br> 
  containing the car class</br> 
  car_class_test_file: </br> 
  containing the method calls of all the methods you created in the car class</br> 
  moto_class_file : </br> 
  containing the moto class</br> 
  moto_class_test_file : </br> 
  containing the method calls for the moto class</br> 
  
  <h4>This makes the total of 7 files.</h4></br>

<h2>Question 2</h2>

<p>
	Dangote  is happy with your help so far, but he would like to make some changes.</br>

</p>

<p>
	<h4>Here too I expect a total of 7 files</h4> </br> 
	Structured in the following way </br> 
	main_program_file : </br> 
	containing the controll flow of your whole program</br> 
	bank_account_file : </br> 
	containg the parent bank account class</br> 
	bank_account_test_file : </br> 
	containing method calls of all the methods you created in the bank account class</br> 
	saving_account_class_file : </br> 
	containing the saving account class</br> 
	test_saving_account_class_file:</br> 
	containing method calls of all the methods you have created in the saving account class</br> 
	current_account_class_file:</br> 
	containing the current account class</br> 
	current_account_class_test_file:</br> 
	containing the method calls of all the methods you created for the current account class</br> 
</p>
